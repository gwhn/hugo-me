# Quick Start

I have decided to give Hugo, the website generator, a go (pun intended).

This is the first post and I am using a theme called blank.

I will use this site for:

- bookmarks
- snippets
- wiki
- articles

I'm going to add an image to see where I can put associated content. I don't
really want to put it in the static folder, so I'll start by creating an images
subfolder and see if that works.
