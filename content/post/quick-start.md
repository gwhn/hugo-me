# Quick Start

I have decided to give Hugo, the website generator, a go (pun intended).

This is the first post and I am using a theme called blank.

I will use this site for:

- bookmarks
- snippets
- wiki
- articles

I'm going to add an image to see where I can put associated content. I don't
really want to put it in the static folder. I discovered that you can create
a folder with the same name as the markdown file and put images in there. You
don't need to add a relative path either, just the filename.
